# Netlogo 3D Engine
This is an engine made in Netlogo using no hardware acceleration aside from drawing individual pixels.

This was done as a project just to see if I could figure out how to make such an effect, especially in a language like Netlogo. Although some bugs remain, the overall project and idea was successful.

## Some More Info
The file named "3D_GAME_1-15-2017.nlogo" is the main product, a game in which the player shoots targets as quick as they can in 9 hand made maps. The editor nlogo file functions, but is extremely messy and undocumented.
